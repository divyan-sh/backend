$ REPL Node.js
  # Read Eval Print and Loop (REPL)
  It specifies a computer environment like a window console or a Unix/Linux shell where you can enter the commands and the system responds with an output in an interactive mode.

>> Basically it is noting but just a simple shell in which you write chunks of JS code and the engine behind node.js that is v8 chrome engine interpret it and give you the output.

#Just like JShell in JAVA. ^_^

-- The Node.js or node come bundled with REPL environment. 
* all you have to do is open your cmd or linux shell and just type node and hit enter that's all you have successfully landed in REPL environment ^_~.

Each part of the REPL environment has a specific work-->

#1> Read: It reads user's input; parse the input into JavaScript data-structure and stores in memory.
#2> Eval: It takes and evaluates the data structure.
#3> Print: It prints the result.
#4> Loop: It loops the above command until user press ctrl-c twice.


$ Simple expressions: After starting REPL node command prompt put any mathematical expression:

Ab yaha konsa code likhu cmd me jake krna gadheðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£ chal example toh de hi skta hu-->
> 10-10
0
> 10-10-20-45-10000000000000000+100000000000000000
89999999999999940



$ Using variable:
# Variables are used to store values and print later.
# If you don't use var keyword then value is stored in the variable and printed
# whereas if var keyword is used then value is stored but not printed, & then You can print variables using console.log().

Try it bro down in the CMD heheheðŸ˜‚
> a="cnu"
'cnu'
> a=cnu
Uncaught ReferenceError: cnu is not defined
> a='cnu'
'cnu'
> var b='shraddha'
undefined
> b
'shraddha'
> console.log(b)
shraddha
undefined

$ Multiline expressions: Node REPL supports multiline expressions like JavaScript. 
See the following do-while loop example:
> var i=0
undefined
> do{
... i++
... console.log("i:", i)
... } while(i<5)
i: 1
i: 2
i: 3
i: 4
i: 5
undefined

$ Underscore Variable: You can also use underscore _ to get the last result. 
> var a=50
undefined
> var b=50
undefined
> a*b
2500
> sum= _ // here i use _ to fetch the last result and store it in sum.
2500
> console.log(sum)
2500
undefined
