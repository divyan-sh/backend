$ I am damm confused MAN..

I just saw the use of fs module that is file system module and i little bit surprised so i ask my self a Question am i working on JS..

Strange NA..ðŸ˜‚

Until now what we are doing we write our basic JS code in .js file then include in our HTML file and then when we run .html file on our browser.

our browser read that html file and then displays the corresponding output on our screen,
during the parsing of our html file by the browser if a browser found a JS code or file it send that file to its JS compiler,

that is V8 chrome engine and then the compiler interprets the js code into an machine understate code so that browser can understate what is written in that JS file and the displays the output corresponding to that JS file..

AND now what we are doing is that we out js code in a JS file and then using node.js which is basically a JS compiler interprets oru JS code and then simply show us the output.

Ohkay is that simply but my point of confusion is 
i use file system module and write code to play with file system 
now i am not getting it how JS able to create files in my system

well i also have answer to this-->

here we install node.js in our machine that is we have our V8 chrome now in our machine that means now we can communicate with our machine in javascript and node.js will interprets that code into machine understate code so that is how now with the use of JS now i am able to communicate with my machine, create files , alter files and etc.
