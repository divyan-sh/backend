$ MongoDB vs MySQL
we already seen the difference between RDBMS and NRDBMS, but this time let's get deeper into each of it..

# In MySql we store data in the form of rows and columns.
  i.e first we create our database and then we table then we create columns of different data fields and now we insert our data in the form of rows..
  > Example: Suppose i want to store name and number of a user then
    + First i Create a Table name 'userInfo'
    + Then i will create two columns, one for "userName" and the other for "userNum"
    + Then i will insert the data in each column and this will from my one row.
      >> Table: UserInfo
    __________________________
    |__userName__|__userNum__|
    |__cnu_______|__1232_____|
    |__punit_____|__9900_____|

  BUT
# In MongoDB we store data in the Form of BSON format(for now assume BSON and JSON are same) i.e JSON like format
  In which instead of creating a Table we create a "Collection" and then we don't need to create separate columns for each data we will create a row and inside that row we will insert our data in separate "Fields", now these rows are called "Document".
  > Example": Suppose i want to store data of a user registration..(name,email,username,password,number)
  + Create a collection name it: "userInfo".
    collection: userInfo
    [
        //documents
    ]
  + Now for each user create a separate document: 
    [
        {
            // Fields.
        }
    ]
  + Till now we have successfully create are database structure now let's add fields in the document..NOTE: you must add id field which should be unique to every user, using this id we reference our document of particular user.
    [
        {
              "_id": ObjectId("12873378214618327"),
              "name": "Divyansh Thakur",
              "email": "its.div09@gmail.com",
              "userName": "hey-developer",
              "password": "cnu@123",
              "number": "122398392",
        }
    ]
 + Now if you want to add another user.. simply add another document. like this..
   Note: MongoDB Provides us more flexibility than MySql for ex if i want to add a filed into a document,
   then i don't need to add that field into every document.
   ? i.e no of fields can vary document by document..
    [
        {
              "_id": ObjectId("12873378214618327"),
              "name": "Divyansh Thakur",
              "email": "its.div09@gmail.com",
              "userName": "hey-developer",
              "password": "cnu@123",
              "number": "122398392",
        },
        {
              "_id": ObjectId("73648236409813648"),
              "name": "Punit Solanki",
              "email": "punit09@gmail.com",
              "userName": "prince77",
              "password": "punit@123",
              "number": "122398392",
              "activity" : "unActive",
        }
    ]
