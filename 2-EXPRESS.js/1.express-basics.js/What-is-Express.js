/* 
$ Express.js is a web framework for Node.js. It is a fast, robust and asynchronous in nature.

So basically it is tool that helps you for faster development at server side..

With the help of Express.js we will see server-side-rendering, get and post request, REST API, routing, email, auth,etc.

There are also other frameworks for server-side rendering like-->
-- Hapi
-- Geddy
-- Locomotive
-- Koa
-- Total.js
-- keystone
-- Meteor.js

but among all of them Express.js is the most popular framework of Node.js.

# So Let's see some of the core features of Express framework:
  + It can be used to design single-page, multi-page and hybrid web applications.

  + It allows to setup middleware to respond to HTTP Requests.

  + It defines a routing table which is used to perform different actions based on HTTP method and URL.

  + It allows to dynamically render HTML Pages based on passing arguments to templates.


# Why use Express: 
  + Ultra fast I/O
  + Asynchronous and single threaded
  + MVC like structure
  + Robust API makes routing easy


# How to get Started..
  + Assuming youâ€™ve already installed Node.js, create a directory to hold your application, and make that your working directory.
  $ mkdir myapp
  $ cd myapp

  + Use the npm init command to create a package.json file for your application.
  $ npm init -y

  + Now install Express in the myapp directory and save it in the dependencies list. For example:
  $ npm install express --save
  or 
  $ npm install express (if npm --v > 5.0)
